// 8.	Write a java program to create a student class with following attributes: Enrollment_id: Name, Mark of sub1, Mark of sub2, mark of sub3, Total Marks. 
// Total of the three marks must be calculated only when the student passes in all three subjects. The pass mark for each subject is 50. 
// If a candidate fails in any one of the subjects his total mark must be declared as zero. Using this condition write a constructor for this class.
//  Write separate functions for accepting and displaying student details. In the main method create an array of three student objects and display the details.
